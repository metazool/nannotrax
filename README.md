# Introduction

[Nannotax](http://www.mikrotax.org/Nannotax3/index.html) is a *authoritative guide to the biodiversity and taxonomy of coccolithophores* hosted on the Mikrotax platform.

This repository is not affiliated with Mikrotax in any way, it contains an unlicensed and crude screen-scraper that extracts a minimal amount of structured data from that project's web pages.

This was created with the intention of producing a labelled training dataset of low-resolution coccolith images for use with (Torchvision)[https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html]
